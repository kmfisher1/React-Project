              <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>Greetings and Welcome!  My name is Ken Fisher. I'm a User Experience and Design student at WakeTech Community College in Raleigh, NC.  I'm also the owner/operator of Ken Fisher Designs, a up and coming graphic design and web design studio based out of Fuquay Varina, NC.</p>  
            
                <p>I have a long love of HTML and CSS that has started back in the late 90s, when I was in high school.  The Internet was a relatively new social construct at the time, and I found that I enjoyed designing and marking my little corner of it.  I went to college in the early 2000's for English with a focus on secondary education because, at the time, I had toyed with the idea of being a public school teacher.  It didn't take long for me to figure out that path was not for me.</p> 
                
                <p>During my time at the University of Texas @ Arlington, I had the opportunity to collaborate with the founder of a student organization called PAWS (Pet and Animal Wellness Society). They approached me to create the initial version of their website, despite my lack of experience in the IT field and HTML. However, I have maintained my familiarity with HTML/CSS over the past 20 years. To stay updated with the latest industry standards and current trends, I have also periodically returned to WakeTech.</p>  
                
                <p>My love of graphic design started while I was in college as well.  A past time I developed was centered around creative writing.  I found that I wanted to create my own edited images to go along with my written passages, and soon learned to edit images on a program called Microsoft Photodraw.  Since I've taken classes on Illustrator and Photoshop. </p>
                
                <p>Aside from my academic pursuits, I have a strong belief that there are two major pillars that support a happy and well rounded life: Family and Faith.  I am a devout father and husband of 15 years.  I have 7 children, with the oldest now in highschool, while my youngest is so young we still count is age in days.  I am also a very devout Christian, and in a world where it seems almost taboo to acknowledge it, I will proudly say that I believe in God, and his son Jesus Christ, and I follow the bible as my compass.  </p>

                <p>Ken Fisher has lived in the Raleigh Area for the last 15 years.   </p>
